# random-quote-machine
This simple app has a fun retro look and is fully responsive.
It is uses the fetch API to grab some random quote data as a JSON from https://stormconsultancy.co.uk/ (who generously provides this microservice for free). This app also utilizes the Twitter API to allow you to easily re-tweet the quote.
